**This package is still under active development. If you see this message, assume that several parts of the package don't quite work yet.**

## Description
This package allows automated creation of flow diagrams for compartmental simulation models using ggplot. Other types of flow charts are also supported.

## Getting Started

For the very impatient, here are few lines of code that make a simple diagram using `r pkg`

```{r}
library(flowdiagramr)
#specify model
mymodel = list( varlabels = c("S","I","R"),
                flows = list(S_flows = c("-b*S*I"), 
                             I_flows = c("b*S*I","-g*I"), 
                             R_flows = c("g*I"))
              )
#prepare diagram
diagram_list <- prepare_diagram(mymodel)
#make diagram
my_diagram <- make_diagram(diagram_list)
#plot diagram
plot(my_diagram)
```

If you think something like this is of interest to you, hop on over to the  [_Quick Start_ tutorial (vignette)](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/A_quickstart.html).


## Further information

`pkg` gives you many options to easily customize diagrams. You can also make diagrams that are not based on compartmental models.
To explain (most) everything `pkg` can do, we wrote several tutorials/vignettes. Here they are listed for convenience.

**Main tutorials/vignettes**

*You should go through them in this order*

1. [Quick start guide](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/A_quickstart.html)
2. [Basic modification of diagrams](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/B_modify_diagrams_simple.html) 
3. [Modifying the input structure](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/C_modify_input_structure.html)
4. [Modifying the ggplot2 code](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/D_modify_ggplot_code.html)

**Additional tutorials/vignettes**

*Read them based on interest, in any order*

*  [More model examples](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/E_non_model_diagrams.html)
*  [Making non-model based diagrams](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/F_more_model_examples.html)
