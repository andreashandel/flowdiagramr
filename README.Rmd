**This package is still under active development. If you see this message, assume that several parts of the package don't quite work yet.**

## Description

**`r pkg`** allows automated creation of flow diagrams for compartmental simulation models using ggplot. Other types of flow charts are also supported.

## Quick example

These few lines of code create a simple diagram of and SIR model using **`r pkg`**

```{r}
#install if needed - package is not yet on CRAN
# remotes::install_github('andreashandel/flowdiagramr')
library(flowdiagramr)
#specify model
mymodel = list( varlabels = c("S","I","R"),
                flows = list(S_flows = c("-b*S*I"), 
                             I_flows = c("b*S*I","-g*I"), 
                             R_flows = c("g*I"))
              )
#prepare diagram
diagram_list <- prepare_diagram(mymodel)
#make diagram
my_diagram <- make_diagram(diagram_list)
#plot diagram
plot(my_diagram)
```


## Getting Started

If you think something like this is of interest to you, hop on over to the  [_Quick Start_ tutorial (vignette)](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/A_quickstart.html).


## Further information

**`r pkg`** gives you many options to easily customize diagrams. You can also make diagrams that are not based on compartmental models. To explain (most) everything **`r pkg`** can do, we wrote several tutorials/vignettes. Here they are listed for convenience.

**Main tutorials/vignettes**
