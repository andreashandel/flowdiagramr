Reorg vignettes. Current thought:
- One quick start from a user perspective (quick up and running). Show a manual model. 
- One adjusting a plot by 'hacking' the ggplot or hacking the diagram_dfs structure
- One 'technical/behind the scences'

Need to show a few examples in help file for make_diagram

As possible, use fs package for file/path operations (e.g. saving R code), seems better then base R
