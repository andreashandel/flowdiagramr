Add something to write_model such that the code has a ggsave statement at the end to save model plot to png file. That could be commented out by default.
If possible, specification to ggsave or for plotting should be such that figure is saved that doesn't contain much whitespace, i.e. cropped tight.

Also maybe switch from print() to plot() statement at end, seems more suitable. 

Thoughts on diagram_list. Would it be hard to change the to/from columns to show labels instead of numbers? I.e. instead of from 1 to 4 it would have S and R in there. Labels are unique, so we should be ok doing that. 
If complicated inside the code, one could still convert from label to number using the $nodes info, but users would see labels in to and from edge entries, so they can more easily hone in on the ones that need adjustment.

See more notes that need addressing in the "Non model diagram" vignette in the "Notes of things that need adressing" section.
