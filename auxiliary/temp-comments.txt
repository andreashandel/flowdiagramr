Add something to write_model such that the code has a ggsave statement at the end to save model plot to png file. That could be commented out by default.
If possible, specification to ggsave or for plotting should be such that figure is saved that doesn't contain much whitespace, i.e. cropped tight.

Also maybe switch from print() to plot() statement at end, seems more suitable.
