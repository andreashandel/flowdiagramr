#' Create data frames for plotting from model elements.
#'
#' @description
#' This function takes as input a model consisting of variables/compartments
#' and flows, and creates a list of data frames with label and position
#' information for plotting a flow diagram.
#' The resulting object is used as an input to \code{\link{make_diagram}},
#' which creates a **ggplot2** based diagram. The function attempts to make
#' decent decisions regarding the placement of variables (boxes),
#' flows (arrows), and labels. However, complex models with complex diagrams
#' will likely need user modification. This is documented in the vignettes.
#'
#' @param model_list A list of model elements. This list is required and
#' must contain these two elements:
#' \itemize{
#' \item `variables`: A character vector specifying the names of all variables.
#' \item `flows`: A list that is the same length as `variables`. Each sub-list
#'     element is a character vector of any length specifying the flows into
#'     and out of the variable. Note that **flowdiagramr** assumes that the
#'     order of `flows` matches that of the `variables` vector.
#' \item IMPORTANT: All `variables` entries must start with an upper case letter,
#'     followed by any combination of letters and numbers
#'     (e.g., S, Si, or Aml2). All parameters contained in `flows` must start
#'     with a lower case letter followed by any combination of letters and
#'     numbers (e.g., b, bBmax, kS, p21S). All variables and parameters MUST
#'     be separated by math notation (e.g., +, -, *, /). Most math functions
#'     (e.g., `sin`, `cos`) are currently not supported.
#' \item See examples and details below and vignettes.
#' }
#'
#' @param model_settings A list of optional settings to adjust layout. The
#'     following elements are supported. If not provided, they default to a
#'     single row and all sizes of 1.
#' \itemize{
#' \item `varlocations`: A matrix containing all `model_list$variables` entries
#'     in specific locations on a grid. See examples.
#' \item `varbox_x_size`: Either a scalar or a vector that changes the default
#'     width of variable boxes. For example, `varbox_x_size = 1.5` makes each
#'     box 1.5 units in width. If a scalar, the value is used for all variables.
#'     If a vector, the length must correspond to number of variables,
#'     and the provided values are applied to the variables in the order
#'     provided in `model_list$vars`.
#' \item `varbox_y_size`: Same as `varbox_x_size` but for the height of
#'     the boxes.
#' \item `varspace_x_size`:  Either a scalar or a vector that changes the
#'     spacing between variable boxes in the x/horizontal dimension. If
#'     `varspace_x_size` is a scalar, all spaces between boxes in the x
#'     direction will be the same. For example, `varspace_x_size = 1.5` puts
#'     1.5 units of space in the x direction between boxes. If you provide a
#'     vector, it needs to be of dimension one less than the number of columns
#'     in `varlocations`. Spacing starts at the left, thus the first number is
#'     the spacing between the first column and second column, etc. Spacing
#'     is measured between the right edge of one box to the left edge of
#'     the next box.
#' \item `varspace_y_size`:  Same as `varspace_y_size` but for the vertical
#'     dimension. If you provide a vector, it needs to be of dimension one
#'     less than the number of rows in `varlocations`. Spacing starts at the
#'     bottom, thus the first number is the spacing between the lowest and
#'     second lowest row, etc. Spacing is measured between the bottom edge
#'     of one box to the top edge og the next box.
#' \item See examples and details below and vignettes.
#' }
#'
#' @return A list of two data frames containing all necessary information
#'         for the model variables/boxes and flows/arrows to be plotted
#'         by the \code{\link{make_diagram}} function.
#'         The data frames are:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item `variables`: A data frame containing information for all variables.
#'   The data frame contains these columns:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `id`: A numeric id for each variable.
#'     \item `name`: The name of the variable as provided in the model
#'         specification.
#'     \item `xmin`: Left edge location of variable box.
#'     \item `xmax`: Right edge location of variable  box.
#'     \item `ymin`: Lower edge of location variable box.
#'     \item `ymax`: Upper edge of location variable  box.
#'     \item `xlabel`: Horizontal position (midpoint) of label.
#'     \item `ylabel`: Vertical position (midpoint) of label.
#'     \item `label_text`: Text that will appear as the label of the box. Can
#'         be different from `name`.
#'     \item `outline_color`: The outline color of variable boxes.
#'     \item `fill_color`: The fill color of the variable boxes.
#'     \item `label_color`: The color of the box labels for each variable.
#'     \item `label_size`: Text size for variable labels.
#'   }
#'
#'   \item `flows`: A data frame containing information for all flows.
#'   The data frame contains these columns:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item `id`: A numeric id for each flow.
#'     \item `name`: The name of the flow. Typically a mathematical expression.
#'         If a main flow with an interaction, this name is for id purposes
#'         only because the `label_text` will be the actual label displayed
#'         in the diagram. Thus, the name might be duplicated in other rows.
#'     \item `type`: Type of flow. One of main, interaction, or external.
#'     \item `from`: The variable from which the arrow originate. That is, the
#'         variable donating the flow.
#'     \item `to`: The variable to which the arrow will point. That is, the
#'         variable receiving the flow.
#'     \item `xstart`: The starting horizontal position of the arrow.
#'     \item `xend`: The ending horizontal position of the arrow.
#'     \item `ystart`: The starting vertical position of the arrow.
#'     \item `yend`: The ending vertical position of the arrow.
#'     \item `xlabel`: Horizontal position (midpoint) of label.
#'     \item `ylabel`: Vertical position (midpoint) of label.
#'     \item `curvature`: The amount of curvature applied to arrow.
#'         Higher numbers indicate more curvature; 0 = straight line.
#'     \item `label_text`: The label that will appear in the diagram. This is a
#'         duplicate of `name` so that user can update `label_text` as desired
#'         but retain the original math for reference.
#'     \item `line_color`: The color of the flow arrow line.
#'     \item `line_size`: The size (width) of the flow arrow line.
#'     \item `line_type`: The linetype of the flow arrow line.
#'     \item `label_color`: Color of `label_text`.
#'     \item `label_size`: The text size of `label_text`.
#'     \item `arrow_size`: The size of the arrow point on the flow line.
#'     \item `show_arrow`: Logical for whether to plot the flow arrow line
#'         (TRUE) or not (FALSE).
#'   }
#' }
#' @details
#'    `variables` needs to be specified as a vector of model variables,
#'     e.g., `variables <- c("Pred","Prey")`. `flows` need to be specified as a
#'    list, with each list entry containing the flows/processes for each
#'    variable in the order in which the variables appear. Flows need to be
#'    named according to `VARIABLENAME_flows`.
#'
#'    Example:
#'
#'    \code{flows <- list(Pred_flows = c(r*Pred, -k1*Pred*Prey),
#'    Prey_flows = c(g*Prey, -k2*Pred*Prey))}. Each flow, i.e. each entry in
#'    the flow vector, needs to be a valid mathematical expression made up of
#'    variables and parameters. The rules are as described above.
#'    As an example, the following includes a parameter *b* and two variables,
#'    *S* and *I*: `b*S*I`. The following includes a parameter *s* and two
#'    variables, *Bg* and *I2*: `Bg*s*I2`. See more examples below and in
#'    the vignettes.
#'
#'    The variables and flows data frames returned in the output list from this
#'    function contain a few columns that are provided to make it easier for
#'    the user to make changes to the data frames manually, but are not used
#'    by the package to make the diagram itself. In the `variables` data frame,
#'    `id` and `name` are unique identifiers that are not used by the package
#'    to make the diagram -- changing these will have no impact on the final
#'    diagram. In the `flows` data frame, `id`, `name`, `from`, and `to` are
#'    identifiers provided to make it easier for the user to understand each
#'    row of the data frame. Changing these columns will have no impact on the
#'    final diagram. All other columns contain information that impacts the
#'    drawn diagram itself. Users can update them -- and may want to in many
#'    cases -- but any updates to values in the remaining columns will be seen
#'    in the diagram itself. See the description of the output data frames below.
