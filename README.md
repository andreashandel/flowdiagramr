**This package is under active development. If you find bugs, or have any other feedback, please let us know (preferably through a GitHub Issue)!**


## Description

This package allows automated creation of flow diagrams for
compartmental simulation models using ggplot. Other types of flow charts
are also supported.

## Getting Started

For an introduction to the package, step-by-step instructions on getting
started, and more information on the different ways you can use the
package [see the *Quick Start* tutorial
(vignette)](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/A_quickstart.html).

## Further information

We wrote several tutorials/vignettes that explain all features of
`flowdiagramr`. Here they are listed for convenience.

**Main tutorials/vignettes**

*You should go through them in this order*

1.  [Quick start guide](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/A_quickstart.html)
2.  [Modifying diagrams I](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/B_prepare_diagram_settings.html)
3.  [Modifying diagrams II](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/C_update_diagram_function.html)
4.  [Modifying the ggplot2 object or code](https://andreashandel.github.io/flowdiagramr/articles/D_modify_ggplot_code.html)
